Given applications $1, 2, \ldots, n$, our goal is to make placement
decisions, assuming that the hardware available is heterogeneous. For now, we
assume machines of three types: $a$, $b$, and $c$ (for example, machines with
K80s, P100s, and V100s).

We assume that a profiling run gives us rough performance estimates for each
of these applications (for example, we can time 100 minibatches of each application
on each hardware, or use collaborative filtering to extrapolate these
times given other measurements).

Let these profiled estimates be $a_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$. Also, let $x_{ai}$, $x_{bi}$, $x_{ci}$ represent
an integer in $\{0, 1\}$ that represents whether application $i$ should be run on
machines $a$, $b$, $c$ respectively. Then, we observe that the following constraints
must hold for all $1 \leq i \leq n$ (each application must be run on exactly
one machine),

\begin{eqnarray}
0 \leq x_{ai}, x_{bi}, x_{ci} \leq 1 \nonumber \\
x_{ai} + x_{bi} + x_{ci} = 1 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Then, we can minimize the total running time across applications by minimizing

\begin{eqnarray}
\min \sum_{i=1}^n (a_i \cdot x_{ai} + b_i \cdot x_{bi} + c_i \cdot x_{ci}) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Note that this doesn't actually optimize ``time-to-completion'' (since applications
can run in parallel), and also doesn't account for the fact that
there are a finite number of resources of each type.
